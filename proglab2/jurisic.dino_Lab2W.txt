    //these only ever worked with Graphics2D. Problem was that the rotation would push it off the view area 
    //and I can't figure out the new coordinates to reset origin
    //g2d.scale(.75, .75); //scaling works fine though
    //g2d.translate(-50*-5, 160*-5);
    
    //get a reference of the affine transform of the original coordinate system so that we can go back to it after our transform
    AffineTransform defaultAt = g2d.getTransform();
    // make new affine transform for rotation
  
    
	//-157.922 is the lowest longtitude and 65 is our highest lat so we can use translate to shift our origin's xy
   g2d.translate(160*13, 50*15);
   g2d.scale(.85, .85); //scaling works too
   
   
   
   
    // draw on the new coordinate system

				Math.round(Airport.Airports.get(i).getLat())*-15 //we do our vertical flip here by multiplying by a negative

Reflections:

I worked with David Pham on this because neither of our partners were present during lab. He was a big help and we both used the premade files from VirginAirJava.txt from the wiki . Much of the stuff I did is commented in. 

To get our actual latitude and longitude we added the following in Airport.java so that we could pull those numbers from Rik's previously created "Airports" ArrayList

//add new publics so that we can pull from our array just like above
   public float getLat() { return latitude; }
   public float getLong() { return longitude; }


I had issues with manually setting the origin and having to reset it after doing any sort of transformation (scaling/rotation,etc). This happens because all the g.translate calls are iterative and work on the last previously set g.translate and so it's really easy to lose what point is your origin. I fixed by casting Graphics2D to Graphics (yay inheritance) (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5289393/casting-variables-in-java) so that I could use an AffineTransform to save and recall my original coordinates.

 At one point I was stuck on doing the translations step by step and rotating, but then I realized I could just flip the map by setting my multiplier on latitude to a negative. My solution isn't the cleanest (positive values for latitude will get flipped the other way) and it has a number of overlaps but it works decently well as a start for our data set. I never could get Rik's neat function trick that he put on the board to work.
